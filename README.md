# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is the deliverable 3 report for challenge 1.

## Overview of Project
### Purpose and Background
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright. She is trying to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play “Fever.” In the previous files, we have helped her by analyzing crowdfunding data to see if there are any factors that make a projects campaign successful. Recently, Louise has almost reached her fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She has asked us to analyze specifically how other campaigns did according to their launch dates and funding goals. The purpose of this analysis is to continue to practice our Excel skills from module 1. This includes the use of filters to refine our data, formulas to get overall values that summarize multiple data points, and to create tables & charts that can help bring a visual understanding of the findings/data. Using these skills, we can help Louise to learn if reaching her goal in a short time frame has a relationship to success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze the outcomes of campaigns (successful, failed, or canceled) based on the date the campaign was launched, we turned to the use of pivot tables and pivot charts. In this analysis we first needed to create a new column of data that has the years which the launch date was created. To do this we used the =YEAR() function on Excel which is explained in [Microsoft Support YEAR](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/year-function-c64f017a-1354-490d-981f-578e8ec8d3b9?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). Now a pivot table can be created using all the data including the new “Year” column. By putting “outcomes” in the columns section, and “date created conversion” in the rows section of the pivot table, we can see the outcomes on the top of the table followed by the dates on the left side of the table. It should be stated that for this challenge, we are looking at the months rather than the years or quarters, so those values are ejected from the selection. After performing this change, we see the months of the year in the rows. Because we are only interested in “theater” campaigns, we can apply this selection in the “parent category” filter to refine our table.

Now that the table is displaying what we are interested in, we can create a line chart to visualize what is happening.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis, we needed to filter the data differently to see the relationship between the funding goal amount and the outcome of the project. Because there is a wide range of funding goal amounts ($1.00 to $200,000.00), we broke the amounts into smaller ranges, mainly in increments of $5000.

![Goal_ranges](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Extra%20resources/Goal_ranges.PNG)

Overall we want to see the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects out of the total number of projects for that range of goals. Also, we are only interested in the outcomes of “plays”. Getting to the percentages required a few steps. First we needed to find the number of successful projects that occurred for plays in each range of goals. To do this, we used the =COUNTIFS() function in Excel which is described here: [Microsoft Support COUNTIFS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). Another video that was extremely helpful and informative was: [Bootcampspot COUNTIFS](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1900/assignments/35945?module_item_id=704534). We repeated this formula for each of the ranges, and then for the number of failed projects, and number of canceled projects while adjusting the formula for each range, and for each outcome. Now we can add up all the projects for that range of goal amount, to get the total number of projects. This was achieved easily with the =SUM() function. More information on this function: [Microsoft Support SUM](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-autosum-to-sum-numbers-543941e7-e783-44ef-8317-7d1bb85fe706#:~:text=If%20you%20need%20to%20sum,function). Now that we have the number of projects in each outcome, along with the total number of projects in that range, we can simply divide the number of successful projects by the total number of projects in that range, and then convert it into a percentage. Repeat this for all the outcomes and we get a table that looks like this:![Goal_vs_outcomes_table](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Extra%20resources/Goal_vs_outcomes_table.PNG) 
After acquiring our desired information, we can represent the data in a line chart that shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each goal range. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were a few challenges that I faced in this analysis. I mainly faced these challenges in deliverable 2, creating the outcomes based on goals chart. Using the =COUNTIFS() function was a little hard to grasp. After watching the video’s and reading the resources, I was able to play around with the criteria range and criteria required in the formula. I mainly struggled with which criteria to put first, and then the order of them in the formula. I overcame this challenge by trying different orders for the criteria and comparing the answers. From the orders that I used, I noticed it did not make much of a difference. I then compared my answers with another classmate who had a different order of the criteria in the formula. We achieved the same results. A minor mistake I caught on my classmates formula was that they included "equal to" on the first =COUNTIFS() for the goal range of "less than 1000". The formula was supposed to be only “less than” since the next range includes “greater than or equal to 1000”. The next challenge I faced in this analysis was getting the calculated percentages to show the percent symbol (%). When I used the =ROUND() function, it would only give me the calculated number without the percent symbol. If I tried to then add the percent symbol, the calculated number would get multiplied by 100, so 76 would become 7600%. To fix this, I simply just divided the “outcome” cell by the “total project” cell of the respected outcome range, and then used the percent symbol button located in the format area of the home tab. This allowed my calculated number to be multiplied by 100, rounded and then a percent symbol to be added. There are some challenges that I think could be encountered like knowing which pivot table fields to place in which value. For example, whether to put the "outcomes" in the columns or rows, and things of that nature. This can easily be solved by moving them around to see which one gives a desired result.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that can be made about the deliverable 1 analysis is that the month of May has the highest amount of successful theater campaigns. After May it starts declining leaving December as the month with the least number of successful campaigns. Based on this, launching a theater campaign in May is a great place to start while starting in December is not. A second conclusion that can be made with this analysis is that failed campaigns for theater seem to have a less clear trend. It seems that any month will provide the same result for failure, which could mean that there is another factor driving the success or failure of a campaign other than launch date. The same is true for canceled with an even flatter trend.   

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The main conclusion that can be drawn is that the lower the goal of the project is, the more likely it is to be successful. It tapers down as the goal gets higher. This is also true by looking at the table. The table shows the greatest number of projects in the lower goal ranges while there are not a lot of plays that have high goal amounts. There is a spike in the 35000 to 45000 range which could have been caused by outliers. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset could be the lack of data. For example, if there was more data for the higher goal ranges, we could have more information and data points to work with instead of letting a handful of plays determine the success or failure percentage. There are also outliers to consider. What if these outliers are skewing the data and giving us false information on the success or failure percentages? Perhaps finding any possible outliers and correcting or removing them can show a clearer picture or change the data completely. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create an analysis for the outcome of campaigns that succeeded or failed based on their launch date AND deadline. Maybe having a wider time frame hindered other campaigns or instead helped them achieve their goal. This could be vital information for a campaign with a huge goal and a short time frame, which could explain why they might have failed. Another analysis I think could help would be to combine both charts created in this challenge to find out what month of the year did these successful or failed projects launch based on their goal ranges. Perhaps all the higher goal ranges decided to launch their campaigns in December and that’s why they failed instead of launching in May or June.
